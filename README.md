# Pineapple
MILL5's core libraries for .NET

Pineapple is a set of core libraries that includes utilities, primitives, helper classes and more!  The inspiration for Pineapple comes from Google's Guava framework.

We plan to offer Pineapple in two flavors.

1) A NuGet library downloadable as a .NET Core library known asPineapple.Common [Available]
2) A Shared Class library of internal classes which can be embedded into your assemblies [Planned]
